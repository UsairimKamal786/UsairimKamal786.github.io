## 🛠️ Technologies Used
I use a mix of web technologies to bring games to life:  
- **HTML5** for game structure  
- **CSS3** for style, animation, and effects  
- **JavaScript** for game logic and interactivity  
- **GitHub Pages** to host games online  
- Optional: frameworks or libraries like **p5.js** or **Phaser**
